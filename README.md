# DataPipeline

Will Upload Soon

Basically it will contain the steps on how to use Hadoop and Spark. 

 ## About the Project
  - It is basically a pipeline, where I upload the data on HDFS, with the help of PySpark. I call the data into my Session/Py File. Do some Cleaning/Modeling and I can upload it directly from the PySpark to HDFS.
  - Making a MACHINE LEARNING MODEL based on TIPS.CSV and saving the Model on HDFS. Calling the Model and predicting the prices of Random.csv and identifying how close was it from the Expected.
  - It is a Linear Regression Problem, using simple LinearRegression Library.
  - Finally, importing the both CSV file on POWERBI and create a small DashBoard(NOT COMPLETED YET,will post it soo


    
## LEARNINGS:
1. HOW TO CONFIGURE HADOOP( TOOK ME WHOLE 2 DAYS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PROPER INSTALLATION GUIDE ON WINDOWS). Also I was following a version where it install on VMWARE which took me another Day)
2. Thinking PySpark should open with HADOOP. You can just simply install use the library on Jupyter Lab. Install the files. Only Problem I am currently Facing is that it is not working on Visual Code. Even after doing `pip install pyspark`, It doesn't recognize the library. I don't know why ( TOOK ME 2 DAYS)
3. Programming ( TOOK ME FEW HOURS TO UNDERSTAND, it is similar to Pandas Library but with some tweaks. I believe there is some library that converts PySpark to pandas, Will look into it in the Future)
4. Trying to Connect it with POWERBI ( Took me around 1 Day, It was a rookie mistake, but hey I'm new in this. I was using a different address connecting the the POWERBI)
5. Good Learning, however I'm gonna work on New Libraries such as Kafka,Hive,Airflow( I don't know what these do, hopefully in the next few months)

There are 2 CSV Files
1. Tips.csv
2. RandomTips.csv
- These are popular datasets and you can find them anywhere, Randomtips is a randomly generated CSV file for testing.

  ## Installing Hadoop on Windows
  1. Install Java ( REMEMBER TO KEEP THE VERSION BETWEEN 8 OR 11 ), if you have latest Java, just download the zip file of the old version and make a directory on C:\Java and extract the zip file there.
  2. After Unzipping, make sure go to Hadoop website and download the 3.X version and just download the file. It will be extractable after the download has been completed.
  3. Remember, to extract it on C:\Hadoop, name doesn't matter.
